# Car-Price-Prediction
 This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting car prices based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and other relevant attributes. The goal of this project is to build a robust predictive model that can estimate the price of a used car accurately, leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques.
